Hi there!  Another great song by Ed!!  I originally
tabbed this to the live version found on YouTube
but now the Cd version is out so it has been updated 
to play directly along to that CD version. Lyrics and
capo change is all.  No chord changes.

Am7 [x02010] -If you strum the song and can't hear a difference
              between the C and Am7, make sure you're strumming
              the Am7 just like the diagram. 

****
NOTE- When transposed up 2x's to remove the capo, use D/F# for the Bm7 (Am7).
****  A C/E sounds the same as a C so it didn't work for this CAPO ON 2 version. 



(2 strums/beats per chord on everything but pre-chorus parts or *single
 strum parts obviously ;)
 

**CAPO 2= CD VERSION. CAPO 1 or even NO CAPO for some LIVE VERSIONS. I like this live version 
                             and it is capo on 1- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=402Rkfnq_ys
  


STANDARD TUNING W/
CAPO ON 2** (See 'NOTE' above if your transposing to remove the capo.)

(*= one strum)



C          Am7                         
 When your legs don't work 
          F             G 
Like they used to before
C            Am7                   F    G 
 And I can't sweep you off of your feet
C          Am7                        
 Will your mouth still remember 
    F               G
The taste of my love
C          Am7                
 Will your eyes still smile 
F               G
From your cheeks


                          
            C  Am7           F    G              C   Am7  F  G
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're seventy
           C   Am7                   F  G           C    Am7  
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
F                 G
And I'm thinking 'bout how 



Dm                       G        C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Dm                        G
Maybe just the touch of a hand
     Dm                            G         Am
Well me I fall in love with you every single day 
    Dm                      GGGGG -stop
And I just wanna tell you I am



         C    Am7  F
So honey now
        G                C   Am7  F
Take me into your loving arms 
        G                    C           Am7  F
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
           G                  C     Am7
Place your head on my beating heart 
             F     G
I'm thinking out loud
          Am* C/B*  F*   C*    F*    G* C
And maybe we  found love right where we are




C        Am7                       F           G
 When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
C        Am7                      F    G
 And the crowds don't remember my name
C        Am7         F                    G           C
 When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
       Am7                        F    G
I know you will still love me the same




              C   Am7             F    G                 C  Am7  F  G
Cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen
           C    Am7           F     G            C  Am7  F  
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
              G
I'm thinking 'bout how


 
Dm                       G        C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
    Dm                       G
And maybe it's all part of a plan
     Dm                           Am     Am7
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes 
Dm                      GGGGG -stop
Hoping that you'll understand




          C    Am7 F
That baby now, oooooh
        G                C   Am7  F
Take me into your loving arms 
        G                    C           Am7  F
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
           G                  C     Am7
Place your head on my beating heart 
             F     G
I'm thinking out loud
           Am* C/B*  F*   C*    F*    G* C
That maybe we  found love right where we are, oh oh



C Am7 F G

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh darlin'
           G                  C     Am7
Place your head on my beating heart 
             F     G
I'm thinking out loud



           Am* C/B*  F*   C*    F*    G* C
That maybe we  found love right where we are
         Am* C/B*  F*   C*    F*    G* C
And baby we  found love right where we are

**To 'Elizabeth' who comment on Live Love Guitar that I stole Thinking Out Loud from UG and posted it on Live 
Love Guitar:-   LLG(heart) and cristy(heart)twilight are the same person- ME. This tab is my work just like the 
tab on Live Love Guitar is my work. Make sense?! I'm both people, lol. I posted MY TAB on both sites.
