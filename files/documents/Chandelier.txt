CAPO 1

Am
Party girls don't get hurt
F
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
G                        Em 
I push it down, push it do--own

Am
I'm the one "for a good time call"
        F
Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
  G                        Em
I feel the love, feel the lo--ove

F
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
Am
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
G
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
G
Throw em back, till I lose count

F         G              C                    F
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
F         G                  C                      F
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
F         G          C                               F
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
F         G              C                    F
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

                F                                       G
And I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
                     C                                          F
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
                     F                                       G
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
                     C                                          F    
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
F
On for tonight

Am
Sun is up, I'm a mess
      F
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
     G                                 Em
Here comes the shame, here comes the sha--ame

F
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
Am
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
G
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
G
Throw em back, till I lose count

F         G              C                    F
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
F         G                  C                      F
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
F         G          C                               F
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
F         G              C                    F
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

                F                                       G
And I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
                     C                                          F
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
                     F                                       G
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes
                     C                                          F    
Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
F
On for tonight
F
On for tonight

And there's a bit of extra riffing at the end with the lyric "on for tonight, 'cause I'm just holding 
for tonight" and the same F G C F chord progression as above.

Happy playing! :D
