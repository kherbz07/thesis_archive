Examples of circular motion include: an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at constant height, a stone which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles, a car turning through a curve in a race track, an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, and a gear turning inside a mechanism.
Well, you can spin something around by a string, like a yoyo, or take a picture of the yoyo itself spinning. You can also take a picture of any spinning object in the air. Also a continuous clock second hand (not a 'jumpy one' that only moves once a secon) on an analog clock. Turning a door handle or opening a door or cupboard could be considered uniform for part of the motion (though it needs to speed up and slow down at the end). Screwing in our out a light bulb, turning the rod on a set of blinds, or opening a water valve might work as well.
